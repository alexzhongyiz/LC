the following code fails to account for the fact that if you only fuel at the largest and not at the second largest
before the largest, then there is a case that we might not reach the target.

def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        hp,lp,lf,res = [],0,startFuel,0
        if target<= lf:
            return res
        for p,f in stations:
            if target<= lf:
                return res
            if p <= lf:
                heapq.heappush(hp,[-f,p])
            else:
                while hp:
                    pair = heapq.heappop(hp)
                    f,p = -pair[0],pair[1]
                    if p > lp:
                        lp = p
                        lf += f
                        res += 1
                        
            print(p,f,hp,lp,lf)
        return -1
